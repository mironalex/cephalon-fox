Hello and welcome!

This Discord bot is designed to provide a relatively accurate Day/Night cycle for
Warframe - Plains of Eidolon expansion.


## Usage

The bot uses the raise symbol of `~` (tilde)

The only current commands supported are `~time` to get the current Cetus cycle and whether it's night or day. The other command is `~ver` to check the version of the bot that's running.

If you want to run this yourself you'll need to follow standard boilerplate for 
[Discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io)
